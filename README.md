### How to Use
- Select a field with a table in it (you do not need to place the cursor within the table anywhere in the field works)
- Click the edit button (square with a pencil)
  - Click the **Header Row Button** to format only the top row as a header
  - Click the **Header Row+Column Button** to format both the top row and the first column as headers
